# SHNEBsGame
 This game is made using Java in processing3. The following are programming concepts that been used to create this game.

 - Multiple Classes
9 classes used to create this project. In each class is an object and collection of similar functionalities. For example, the background class has the background image, the timer, the different splash screens, etc. a different class was unnecessary as might complicate the code.

 - Constructors
Each class has 1 constructor with appropriate parameters. 

 - Methods
Methods are used wherever appropriate for a specific object. 

 - Public/private
Public was used for the universal values like health and score. Private was used for the variables that only belong to that class.

 - Inheritance Super
Inheritance is used for the collectables. The parent class is gold and then money and health potion added which meant to behave a same. However, the void render is been overridden so they display different animated characters.

 - Meaningful Variable names
	Meaningful variable names are used to simplify the code and make it understandable as the lines of code 		 increase. 
 

 - Constants
Constants are used for loading images using a for loop.
 
 - Functions
 - For Loops
 - If statements
 - Switch case
 - polymorphism & Array List
 - Enum set
